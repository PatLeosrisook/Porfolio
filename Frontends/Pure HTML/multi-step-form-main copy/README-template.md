## Overview

### The challenge
The challange is to build a multi-page form. The requirements of this challange is that users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made


## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
During this short project, there were many trials and errors I had to go through to completion. However, I have learned many valuable lessons from them, and one of the lessons is to plan how I layout my page better so I don't have to redo most of the site if the current one causes unnecessary complexity to the website (which is what happened in my case). Due to bad planning, I only made the site available for desktops with at least 1024px wide and for mobile with 375px wide. 

In any future projects, I will make sure that I am well-planned before starting any coding. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is a very useful source for me whenever I felt stuck or I'm not sure how to do something.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) - This is definitely one of the best tool to have. It helps me find answers that I are not explicitly listed or hard to find in resource websites like MDN.
