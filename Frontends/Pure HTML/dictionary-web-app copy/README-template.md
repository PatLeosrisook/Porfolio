## Overview
This project is part of a challenge I took from [FrontendMentor](www.frontendmentor.io) as a way to practice the skill set I have. 
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search for words using the input field
- See the Free Dictionary API's response for the searched word
- See a form validation message when trying to submit a blank form
- Play the audio file for a word when it's available
- Switch between serif, sans serif, and monospace fonts
- Switch between light and dark themes
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## How to run the project.
Direct to the 'dicitonary' folder and open the index.html file. The program will run immediately.

## My process
1. Look through the design file that was given by the challenge.
2. Identify what kind of layout needed within each component.
3. Here I start building the structure of the program with HTML
4. Then I'll start styling mobile-first approach.
5. Once I have the structure and a the styling, I start adding in the functionality via JS
6. After the functionality is implemented, I continue  to design for all other device sizes.

### Built with

-  HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
