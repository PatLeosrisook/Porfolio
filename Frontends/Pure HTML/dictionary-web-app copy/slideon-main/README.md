## Why slideon over other components
No latency - while integrating many other similar components, you will see a minor latency(checkbox turning to switch) if your project is huge but not in slideon.

Easy integration - just add some classes to your checkbox.

Different styles - just add some classes for different sizes, shapes and colors.

Events and actions - you can trigger events and actions just like how you do with a normal checkbox.

Light weight - the component is very much lighter.

Faster - the processing of component is faster.
