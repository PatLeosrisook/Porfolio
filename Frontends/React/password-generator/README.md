## Overview
This project one of the challenge I took from [FrontendMentor](www.frontendmentor.io) as a way to practice the skill set I have. 
### The challenge
The challenge is to develop a password generator as per the design given in figma file format by the challenge. 

## How to run the project.
simply run `npm start` to start the application. 

## My process
1. Look through the design file that was given by the challenge.
2. Identify what kind of layout needed within each component.
3. Here I start building the structure of the program with HTML
4. Then I'll start styling mobile-first approach.
5. Once I have the structure and a the styling, I start adding in the functionality via JS
6. After the functionality is implemented, I continue  to design for all other device sizes.

   **Note: My process are identical to every other project I built**

### Built with

-  HTML5 markup
- SASS
- ReactJS
- zxcvbn library for determining the password strength.
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
