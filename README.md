<h1 >Hello!</h1>
I'm Pat, 25 years old based in Bangkok, Thailand and this is my repository. It contains all my frontend projects I worked on behind the scene during my day job. These projects are made using either Pure HTML, CSS and JS or with ReactJS. 
<br/>
<h2>New stacks</h2>
I'm currently learning new technologies to add more onto my tech stack. These are: 
<ul>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Next.js</li>
  <li>TypeScript</li>
</ul>


I'm working on moving from Front-end to Full-stack as it allows bigger options for my next personal projects and for more job opportunity in the future.
